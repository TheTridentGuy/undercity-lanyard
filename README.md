## How to flash it

### Linux edition!

1. Clone the repo
    ```bash
    git clone
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    The script requires a few dependencies, including arduino-cli, image magick, and python. Python should come by default on most systems,
    and you can google how to install arduino-cli and image magick. For me on arch its:
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S imagemagick arduino-cli
    ```
3. Just run the script
    ```bash
    chmod +x upload.sh
    ./upload.sh
    ```
4. Follow the instructions and yay!

## Wooo
